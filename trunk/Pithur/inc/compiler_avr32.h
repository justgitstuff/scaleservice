   The maximal possible delay is 262.14 ms / F_CPU in MHz.

 * Some preprocessor magic to allow for a header file abstraction of
 * interrupt service routine declarations for the IAR compiler.  This
 * requires the use of the C99 _Pragma() directive (rather than the
 * old #pragma one that could not be used as a macro replacement), as
 * well as two different levels of preprocessor concetanations in
 * order to do both, assign the correct interrupt vector name, as well
 * as construct a unique function name for the ISR.
 *
 * Do *NOT* try to reorder the macros below, or you'll suddenly find
 * out about all kinds of IAR bugs...
