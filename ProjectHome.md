# What is Scale? #
> Scale is a fantastic home automation solution.This project is meant to provide a open and friendly interface in different degrees so that both developers and end users can use it to view the home information and control the devices.
# What does Scale provide? #
> ## DistRema Home Automation Interface(PHP/JAVA) ##
> For developers, Scale provide HTTPService interface in both PHP(1.0) and JAVA(2.0). The PHP code runs on a home gateway device called CCR, which provide a Apache http service and an embeded MySQL database; on the other hand, the JAVA code takes advantage of the Google App Engine, and CCR can be free from the large services such as the Apache, and can run all the programmes on ARM CPUs(Apache/PHP needs a Atom CPU at least).
> ## ScaleOTG(Flex) ##
> For users, Scale provide a B/S program called ScaleOTG(Scale On The Go, build with Flex 3.0), through which users can acquire information from the sensor of their home with their Google Account logged in, and they can configure and operate the sensors and devices, as well.
> ## ScaleLocal(AIR) and Pithur Zigbee Network Protocol ##
> Even more, Scale also provide an AIR programme and a set of drivers to run on the CCRs.We call it ScaleLocal. With these programmes, CCR can collect the informations from the Zigbee wireless sensor network(We own the Zigbee Network Protocol called Pithur), and control the devices through the network as well.
# Every thing is Flexible #
> All the things mentioned above is not necessary to provide a stable and functional home automation system. Instead, you can only use one or several of them. To accomplish that, you need to have some knowledge of our interfaces(DistRema,Riab,Pithur). For more information, please visit the Wiki page or contact with us.
